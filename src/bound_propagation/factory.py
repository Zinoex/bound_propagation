    This class is a combination of the factory and visitor pattern to construct the bound module graph recursively while
    being flexible to add new types.
    As an example, say you design a new nn.Module subtype and let that be a layer in a nn.Sequential. With the factory,
    you can add the new subtype to the factory, and when constructing BoundSequential, this will be recognized.
